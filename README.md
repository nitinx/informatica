## Informatica Marketplace Solution

## Business Requirement
Metadata-driven file comparison utility that automates regression testing of delimited flat files and significantly reduces the testing/comparison effort involved.

## Project Description
Flat files are a popular mode of transferring data. At times there is a need to compare flat files generated in Data Warehousing / Data Integration environments (to determine the impact, if any, of a code change / enhancement / etc.), especially if these files happen to be reports shared with downstream users.

Informatica PowerCenter File Compare is a metadata-driven utility that helps automate regression testing of delimited flat files. Once the metadata of the files to be compared is made available to the utility, it can compare files of a similar layout and publish the summarized and detail test results. The results are categorized into three reports (tables)-
- Compare File Summary
- Compare Column Summary
- Compare Column Detail
The metadata to be provided includes the file layout, key columns and non-key columns to be compared / ignored.
